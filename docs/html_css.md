# Terminology
## What is the Web?

Sometimes we the Web and the Internet interchangeably, but technically
they refer to two different, albeit related, concepts. The Internet is
an global infrastructure consists of inter-connected networks of computers,
known as the information highway/speed. The Web is one of the services,
similar to email, that runs on the Internet. The Internet provides the
connectivity and the Web provides the service, which allows users to "browse"
and make use of the resources that are available on the Web.

The Web is enabled through a protocol (HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol)
that allows computers on the
Internet to message each other via HTTP requests and responses, which is called
the request and response model. The computer sending a request is called a
client and the computer responding to the request is called a server - the client
server mode.  Most of the time, we (human users) interact
with the web using a program (user agent) called a web browser. The browser
speaks the HTTP protocol so that we don't have to.

When you type a Universal Resource Locator (URL or web address/link) in your favorite browser on an Internet enabled device. Your browser will send a request to the
"resource" identified by the URL and if it exists that computer that has the
resource will send a response back to your browser. The browser will interpret
the result and render it as a web page. If you click a link on a web page, the
browser will likely send another request kicking start another request and
response cycle.

## What is Web Programming?
Programming the Web or building web apps is about making the web richer by
adding more resources to it. The Web is originally designed as a distributed
system for researchers to share their documents. The documents are organized
hierarchically as in a file system. They documents can be accessed using an URL
and each document can have HyperLinks to other documents, therefore, forming a
"web" of documents. At that time a web browser is truly a document browser
allowing us to "browse" statically stored documents. But, nowadays web browsers
are App viewers. The web pages we see in browsers are interfaces to Apps that
provide any functionality possible, from social media, shopping, to entertainment.

Web programming involves both the client side and the server side. On the client
side we need to know how to define interfaces (web pages) using
HTML and CSS and handle user interactions with JavaScript. On the server side,
we need a server side program that can access resources not available on the
client side, e.g. a file system or a database.
